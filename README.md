# Unsupervised-Learning
This repository gives a brief introduction to unsupervised machine learning and its various approaches.
Unsurpervised learning is a machine learning technique that learns patterns from data that is neither classified or labelled. Instead, it allows the model to work on its own to discover patterns and information that was previously undetected.
Unsurpervised learning models are utilized for three main tasks - clustering,association and dimensionality reduction.
Facebook live selling data was used in this project.

Customer Segmentation is one the most important applications of unsupervised learning. Using clustering techniques, companies can identify the several segments of customers allowing them to target the potential user base. In this machine learning project, we will make use of K-means clustering which is the essential algorithm for clustering unlabeled dataset.
