# Unsupervised-Learning
This repository gives a brief introduction to unsupervised machine learning and its various approaches.
Unsurpervised learning is a machine learning technique that learns patterns from data that is neither classified or labelled. Instead, it allows the model to work on its own to discover patterns and information that was previously undetected.
Unsurpervised learning models are utilized for three main tasks - clustering,association and dimensionality reduction.
